<p>Finally, I found time to work on my site again.</p>
<p>It turned out that while I was busy at work and university, <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>, a Haskell library for generating static sites (this site is generated by its means), had been upgraded to version 4, which brought a number of changes. I had to tinker with generator script for some time, but the new monadic architecture is way better than the previous one, and now it is much easier to generate complex things like tags, support for which I have added in this site.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, you can find the source of this generator in my <a href="http://github.com/dpx-infinity/pages-site">Github repo</a>. Maybe I will find another piece of time and make it literal Haskell script embedded in this site.</p>
<p>It slightly bothers me that I’m not writing anything here, but unfortunately I just don’t have time — I’m just near the finish line of my university course, and I have to prepare for the exams and to write my graduation work.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you’re reading this, thanks for your attention.</p>
